<h4>Social media is a vast pool of content, and among all the content available for users to access, news is an element that is accessed most frequently. 
These news can be posted by politicians, news channels, newspaper websites, or even common civilians. 
These posts have to be checked for their authenticity,
since spreading misinformation has been a real concern in todayâ€™s times, and many firms are taking steps to make the common people aware of the consequences of spread misinformation. 
The measure of authenticity of the news posted online cannot be definitively measured, since the manual classification of news is tedious and time-consuming, and is also subject to bias.
